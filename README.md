## Overview

This project has a Dockerfile to deploy an OpenTripPlanner instance, with the GTFS for Switzerland built in. There is also a unittest script to run the instance and check if everything is working.

## Install

```
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Quick start

```
fab go:urls=http://url/to/gtfs.zip,port=80,build=y,name=otpserver
```

Make sure to replace the URL to the actual GTFS feed you want to use. This will build the necessary docker images, build the OTP graph and
start otp server. Access the server at http://localhost:80. You may start as many servers as you want, they don't interfere with each other as
long as you use different ports and a different name for each server. 

To download a new GTFS feed and build again:

```
fab go:urls=http://url/to/new-gtfs.zip,port=80,name=otpserver
```

This will stop (actually, kill and remove) the server, download the GTFS file and restart the server again.
	

## Running the containers manually

First pull the Docker container from the repo (the repo might change):

`docker pull pablokbs/opentripplanner` 

The server and the builder are now separated, but they share the /var/otp directory. The builder will build (doh!) the graphs and place it on the shared directory.

### Starting the server

You can run the server by running the following line, please note the "--name server" that is necessary for the builder container. Note also the **-s** switch, to run the server:

`docker run -p 80:8080 -d --name server pablokbs/opentripplanner:server -s`

That will run a simple ubuntu instance, will download the dependencies and run the server, it might take a few minutes to start. After starting, you can browse the ip of the server, that will be redirected to the 8080 port on the container. The `-d`switch puts the container on daemon mode.

To see the running docker instances, just type:

`docker ps`

Some useful commands:

```
## Stop the container
# docker stop <container>

## Start the container
# docker start <container>

## Restart the container
# docker restart <container>

## SIGKILL a container
# docker kill <container>

## Remove a container
# docker stop <container> # Container must be stopped to remove it
# docker rm <container>
```

### Building the graph

Now it's possible to build a new graph for the server. It's easy to use:

`docker run --volumes-from server pablokbs/opentripplanner:builder -u "url1 url2 ... urln" -e "--noStreets --longDistance"`

That will download the GTFS and/or PDX from the specified urls (you can specify as many url as you want). You can also pass variables to otp with the "-e" switch. It will build the graph and also will place the generated graph into the right dir.

After building the graph you should reload the server container:

`docker restart server`

IMPORTANT: The **server** container must be running before running the builds. Because the shared volume is created by the server container.. 

## Starting nginx

It's also possible to start a nginx proxy server to balance the load and run multiple "server" containers. The command line is the following:

`docker run -p 80:80 -d --name nginx pablokbs/opentripplanner:nginx <SERVER1_IP:PORT> <SERVER2_IP:PORT> ... <SERVERN_IP:PORT>`

That will create a ubuntu container, download puppet, get the nginx module and configure nginx to forward the traffic to the IPs configured as arguments, you can use as many arguments as you want.

## Unit testing

We've implemented a script that has the ability to both run and test if the container is working as expected. In order to run it, we will need some dependencies on the server:

`apt-get install python-pip && pip -q install docker-py`

That's it! That's all we need to run the test. Remember that Docker version > 1.3 is required.

To run the test:

`./unittest.py pablokbs/opentripplanner:latest`

This is an example output:

```
2014-12-02 10:54:52,157 - unittest.py - INFO - Creating container.
2014-12-02 10:54:52,301 - unittest.py - INFO - Starting container.

2014-12-02 11:01:30,380 - unittest.py - INFO - Everything looks OK. Exiting
```

As you can see, it creates the container, starts it, and tests a little search.

### Building the images

Other then the unit test above, we provide a simple Python Fabric script:

```
# build the images
fab build_server build_builder build_nginx
docker images | grep opentripplanner
```
